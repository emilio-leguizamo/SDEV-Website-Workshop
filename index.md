Hi! I am a second-year PhD student in the Sustainable Development program at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs.

My primary research interests are in environemntal economics, development and health.

Prior to joining Columbia, I worked at Universided de los Andes (Colombia) and the Inter-American Development Bank doing research in environemntal economics in developing contexts.

I hold a BA and MA degree in Economics from Universided de los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia.
